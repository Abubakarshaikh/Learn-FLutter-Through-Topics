[Concurrency in Dart]

[Thread]
* A thread is a sequence of commands that a computer executes.
* Some programming languages support multithreading, which is running multiple threads at the same time, while others do not.
* Dart, in particular, is a single-threaded language.


[Parallelism vs. Concurrency]
* Parallelism is when multiple tasks run at the same time on
multiple processors or CPU cores. 

* Concurrency, on the other
hand, is when multiple tasks take turns running on a single
CPU core.

* When a restaurant has a single person alternately
taking orders and clearing tables, that’s concurrency.

* But a restaurant that has one person taking orders and a different
person clearing tables, that’s parallelism.
